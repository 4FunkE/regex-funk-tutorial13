# Exploring Regex with Funk: Tackling the "HTML Tag Matcher" Regular Expression

Welcome to Funk's regex tutorial, using FunkE learning! As aspiring web developer, you're no stranger to the world of HTML tags. In this comprehensive tutorial, we'll dive into the complexities of a regular expression (regex) tailored to match and dissect HTML tags. Regex is a powerful tools using a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern for text, using pattern matching and validation. Regex follows "literal characters" or "Meta-characters." By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how this regex works and be well-prepared to implement it in your coding adventures.

## Summary

Briefly summarize the HTML tag regex you will be describing and what you will explain for your tutorial. Include a code snippet of the regex.

In this tutorial, we will unravel and understand the regular expression `/^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/`, designed to match HTML tags. Our focus will be on breaking down each part of this regex, guiding you through its intricacies step by step. Let's break down each component step by step.

- Anchors `^` and `$`

- The `+` Quantifier

- position 

- Literal Character `@`(literal search of specific parameters)
-, a, 1, !, @, #, $, %, 

- Period `.` as a Metacharacter (vague/generic search with same parameters) there are sudlte difference between each program being used. types of meta are single quantify and position.
\d : means any digit 0-9 single characters
\w = A-Z,a-z,0-9 characters single characters w stands for word
\s = whitespace single characters
. = any character single characters
* = quantifier, 0 or more 
+ = quantifier 1 or more
? = quantifier 0 or 1
{min,max}
{n}- ad an interger of characters
.* = wildcard match a literal with any number of any characters
^ = beginning
$ = end
\b = word boundary

- Putting It All Together

## Regex Components
### Anchors `^` and `$` <a name="anchors"></a>
The journey begins with a close look at ^ and $, the anchors that mark the start and end of the line. These anchors ensure our regex applies to the entire line, which is vital when handling HTML tags.

### Quantifiers <a name="quantifiers"></a>
Quantifiers like +, *, and ? provide flexibility in matching patterns. We'll dive into how these quantifiers play a role in our HTML tag regex.

### Grouping Constructs

### Bracket Expressions

### Character Classes

### The OR Operator

### Flags

### Character Escapes

### Backreferences
Explore how backreferences like \1, \2, etc., are used to match previously captured groups and maintain consistency within HTML tags.

### Non-Capturing Groups
Learn about non-capturing groups (?:...) and how they provide a way to group elements without capturing them as separate groups, which can be particularly useful when dealing with complex regex patterns.

### Lookahead and Lookbehind
Delve into lookahead (?=...) and lookbehind (?<=...) assertions. These constructs allow you to assert whether a certain pattern exists ahead or behind the current position without consuming characters, enabling more sophisticated matching strategies.
