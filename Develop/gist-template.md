# Exploring Regex with Funk: Tackling the "HTML Tag Matcher" Regular Expression

Welcome to Funk's regex tutorial, using FunkE learning! As aspiring web developer, you're no stranger to the world of HTML tags. In this comprehensive tutorial, we'll dive into the complexities of a regular expression (regex) tailored to match and dissect HTML tags. Regex is a powerful tools for pattern matching and validation. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how this regex works and be well-prepared to implement it in your coding adventures.

## Summary

Briefly summarize the HTML tag regex you will be describing and what you will explain for your tutorial. Include a code snippet of the regex.

In this tutorial, we will unravel and understand the regular expression `/^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/`, designed to match HTML tags. Our focus will be on breaking down each part of this regex, guiding you through its intricacies step by step. Let's break down each component step by step.

## Regex Components

### Anchors <a name="anchors"></a>
The journey begins with a close look at ^ and $, the anchors that mark the start and end of the line. These anchors ensure our regex applies to the entire line, which is vital when handling HTML tags.

### Quantifiers <a name="quantifiers"></a>
Quantifiers like +, *, and ? provide flexibility in matching patterns. We'll dive into how these quantifiers play a role in our HTML tag regex.
